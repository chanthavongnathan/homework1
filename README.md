I went through the html and saw a few errors. 
Changed the headers from 'div' to 'sections'.
Added alts to the images.
made the nav bar a nav element.
added an id to the search engine optimization so it would jump to the part of the page like the other links. 
i also had to edit the css. i changed the .header div to .header nav so it could match the html. when it was still .header div the page looked really messed up.
